                This unit provided an introduction to information security, enabling myself to identify and discuss fundamental information security issues. The unit considers both technical and non-technical measures used to provide security for information systems, and examines guidelines on best practice implementation of information security measures. The interconnectedness of many information systems means that the actions of individuals may impact on many others. This unit was important in developing an understanding of the challenges involved in providing appropriate protection for information, both for myself as an individual and as a working professional.
